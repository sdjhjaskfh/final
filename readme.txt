Firstly, I want to remind you that the program developed by the Python 3.8.10, which means maybe you need to download this version of the Python.

Here are some tips about how to play in this program.

In the Start window, you can click the Start Game button to play the game, or you can click the Quit Game to shut down the whole program.

When you click the Start Game button, you can enter a new window. In this window, you can check all the cards on your right side by double clicking. 

The game rules will appear on your left side. 

You need to remember all the cards name and its position which will be used in the next window. 

When you are ready, click the button. 

Then you will randomly get a name of one of the nine cards, you need to choose the right card.
